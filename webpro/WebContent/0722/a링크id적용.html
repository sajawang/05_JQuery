<h2 id="tennis1">1.Preview</h2>
The men's Swedish Open (sponsored by Skistar) is an ATP Tour 250 tennis tournament on the ATP Tour held in Båstad, Sweden in July.

The women's Swedish Open (sponsored by Collector) is a tennis tournament held in Båstad, Sweden, between 2009 and 2017 as an International tournament and successor to the Nordic Light Open in Stockholm, and from 2019 onwards a challenger-level tournament. It is played on outdoor clay courts.

<h2 id="tennis2">2.History</h2>
The Swedish Open was first held in 1948 when it was called the International Swedish Hard Court Championships.[1] Between 1970 and 1989 the men's event was part of the Grand Prix tennis circuit.

The first three tournaments were won by Eric Sturgess from South Africa. Other famous champions include Ilie Năstase (1971), Björn Borg (1974, 1978–1979), Mats Wilander (1982–1983, 1985), and Rafael Nadal (2005). The stadium in which the tournament is held underwent reconstruction in 2002 to accommodate the new hotel underneath the seaside bleachers.

From 1948 to 1990, there was also a women's singles tournament. After the Nordic Light Open in Stockholm was sold, it was announced that the women's event would return to Båstad. Since 2009 the Collector Swedish Open Women in Båstad has been an International-level tournament. In 2018 the women's tournament license was sold and it was held in Moscow (Russia) as Moscow River Cup from 22 to 27 July 2018. However, in 2019, the tournaments was reinstated as WTA 125K series tournament.

<h2 id="tennis3">3.2024 Swedish open</h2>
World number 51 Nuno Borges beat Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-2 to win the Swedish Open in Bastad.

Spaniard Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, slipped to a resounding defeat in his first final since 2022.

Hampered by injury in recent years, the 38-year-old has fallen to 261 in the rankings and opted against playing at Wimbledon this summer to prioritise the Olympics.

Portuguese Borges, playing his first ATP final compared to Nadal's 131st, took the first set in 46 minutes and won three games in a row in the second to seal victory.

"It's crazy. I know we all wanted Rafa to win - a part of me wished that too - but something even bigger inside of me really pushed through today," said 27-year-old Borges.

"I was wishing for this moment for a while already.

"I'm just really happy overall. I really don't know what to say. I'm very emotional."

The Olympic tennis tournament begins in Paris on 27 July.

Nadal has said playing at Roland Garros, where he has won 14 French Open titles, is his "main goal" this year.

In Bastad, Borges overcame Nadal 6-3 6-2, finishing the match slamming down an ace before he fell to his knees and buried his hands in his face, a sign of just what the victory meant to Borges.

It was Borges' first title on the ATP Tour. "I don't know what to say," he reflected afterwards.
